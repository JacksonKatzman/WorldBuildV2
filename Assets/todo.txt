get better terrain textures
also probably cut down on the number of biomes
figure out mountains and mountain blending
ray marching with smooth union for mountains and hills?
also maybe make it so mountains just dont generate on river tiles for now unless its the start tile of the river
have some sort of terrainConfig SO so that each terrain can be treated differently, have different stats, generate accordingly
	- for example, ensuring plains and deserts are flat
fix river generation - they need to start in mountains and be much longer, heading to sea
also figure out beaches
also need to check catlikes project to see how much it struggles iwth big maps
might wanna revert the hexcollections and do it a different way - store the cells in collections still but use a different geometry as an overlay
so that we dont have to do that whole expensive restitching step

before mountains or any of this i think first step is fixing the biomes and the way they are textured <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
