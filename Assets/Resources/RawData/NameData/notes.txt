GOVT:
Leadership Nodes generate as pop/cities increase
Nodes include replacement strategy?
Prio type STYLE that informs the kinds of leaders that get generated
Split leader actions up by prio type, warlike events are recruiting/armoring
Leave war alone, maybe more likely to go to war but dont let government heavily drive this
Govts update at milestones but the way the upgrade is semi random?
Could add leaders or add holidays/policies
The STYLE/prios should start neuatral and be built by these random events
Traditions

fix city gen to check all cities
fix tile capture to not be so erratic - maybe capture ALL border tiles?
