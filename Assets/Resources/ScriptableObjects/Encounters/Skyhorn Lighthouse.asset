        to make any preparations before they get underway.\nIf the players decide
        to interrogate any townsfolk or passersby about the situation in the harbor,
        for each person questioned you can tell them one of the following:\n\u2022
        \"I heard a low keening coming from the harbor last night. It was eerie,
        like the cries of a ghostly whale.\"\n\u2022 \"There might not be any food
        shipments for a while. Nobody will even get out in their damn fishing boats.
        Fools, if you ask me.\"\n\u2022 \"Ain't had any word from the lighthouse
        keepers in days. I hope they're alright.\""
