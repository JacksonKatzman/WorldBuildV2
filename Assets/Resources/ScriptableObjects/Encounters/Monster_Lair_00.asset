        and <0>s of the {0}s echoing through the cave. The entrance to the cave is
        guarded by a pair of {0}s..

        You can see that the cave winds deep
        into the mountain, with various tunnels branching off in different directions.
        You can smell the musky scent of {0}s and the damp earth of the cave. It''s
        clear that the {0}s have been living here for some time, as bones and half-eaten
        corpses of animals are scattered about the cave entrance.'

      Entry: 1
      Data: The most straight-forward way for the party to gain entrance to the {0}s'
        lair, is to fight and dispatch the guards. This approach would require the
        party to have strong combat skills and be well-equipped for fighting against
        {0}s.

    - Name: pathSummary
      Entry: 1
      Data: Another way for the party to gain entrance to the {0}s' lair is by distracting
        the guard {0}s at the main entrance. To do this, the party could use a combination
        of [STEALTH], [DECEPTION], and [NATURE] skills.
    - Name: pathInformation
      Entry: 1
      Data: 'First, the party would need to sneak up to the cave entrance without
        being detected by the guard {0}s. This would require a [GROUP_STEALTH_CHECK].

        Once
        they are close enough, they could attempt to create a distraction that would
        draw the guard {0}s away from the entrance. For example, they could throw
        a rock into a nearby bushes to simulate the noise of an animal running away,
        or mimic the call of a predator to lure the {0}s away. This would require
        a [DECEPTION_CHECK] if using a distraction, or a [NATURE_CHECK] if using
        something like an animal call.

        If the distraction is successful,
        the guard {0}s would leave their post to investigate, giving the party an
        opportunity to slip into the cave unnoticed. However, if the distraction
        fails or the party is not able to create it, the guard {0}s would remain
        at their post and the party would have to find another way to enter the lair.

        It''s
        worth noting that the {0}s being distracted by the party doesn''t guarantee
        that the entire -0- would be away from the lair, so the party would still
        need to be cautious while they are inside the cave.'

      Data: Find a sneaky way in...
    - Name: pathSummary
      Entry: 1
      Data: The party could attempt to be stealthy and find a different way in. To
        do this, the party could use a combination of [STEALTH] and [INVESTIGATION]
        skills.
    - Name: pathInformation
      Entry: 1
      Data: 'Should they choose to attempt this, have them roll a [GROUP_STEALTH_CHECK]
        to see if they can avoid drawing the attention of the guards at the mouth
        fo the lair.

        If they fail this roll, the guards will have spotted
        them, and they will be forced to either run away, or fight the guards.

        However,
        should they succeed, give them this information: "You manage to sneak through
        the underbrush, avoiding the attention of the guards, and make it to a rocky
        outcrop to the right of the cave entrance where you are hidden from view."

        Now
        have each of your players roll a [INVESTIGATION_CHECK]. Shoud they all fail,
        have them select a different strategy for entering the lair.

        If
        even one of them succeeds, give them this information: "As you are exploring
        the area around the cave entrance, you notice that there is a small crevice
        on the side of the mountain that is partially hidden by a thick growth of
        bushes. Upon closer inspection, you realize that the crevice is large enough
        for a person to squeeze through, and it leads deep into the mountain."

        The
        crevice is narrow and dark, and the party must make their way through it
        carefully, as the walls are jagged and the footing is uncertain. As they
        progress through the crevice, they can hear the sound of running water. The
        crevice opens into a small underground stream, that flows into the cave.
        The party can follow the stream, which leads them deeper into the {0}s''
        lair, bypassing the main entrance and the guard {0}s. However, the stream
        is noisy, and the party has to take extra care not to alert the {0}s of their
        presence.'

      Entry: 1
      Data: In order to complete their quest, the party must now delve deep into
        the bowels of the lair and slay the leader of the {0} -0-. Without a leader,
        the -0- will surely disperse.
    - Name: pathInformation
      Entry: 1
      Data: "Begin by giving the players this information: \"The inside of the {0}'s
        lair is dark and damp, with the only light coming from the occasional glow
        of phosphorescent mushrooms that grow in the cave, and small openings in
        the cave's ceiling that let in natural light. The walls are jagged and rough,
        and the floor is covered with loose gravel and bones. You can hear the <0>s
        and <0>s of the {0}s echoing through the cave, as well as the sound of running
        water. The smell of musk and decay is thick in the air.\"\nThe main path
        through the cave twists and turns, with several tunnels branching off in
        different directions. The party must navigate these tunnels carefully, as
        they will have to avoid a pit that has been covered with branches and leaves,
        making it hard to spot. It's located near the first bend in the tunnel, and
        the party will need to make a [PERCEPTION_CHECK] to spot it before blundering
        into it, or an [INVESTIGATION_CHECK] to uncover it if they are actively looking
        for traps.\r\nThe lead {0}\u2019s is located deep within the cave, accessible
        only through a narrow and winding tunnel. As they near the exit to the tunnel,
        give the party this information: \n\u201CThe chamber is large and circular,
        with a high ceiling that is supported by natural columns of rock. The chamber
        is lit by natural light coming from the small openings in the cave's ceiling.
        At the center of the chamber, there is a natural formation that resembles
        a throne made of bones, and upon it lounges what you can only guess must
        be the leader of the {0}s.\u201D\r\nThe leader of the {0}s is the most powerful
        {0} in the -0-, and it's the one that has been coordinating the attacks on
        the town's livestock. The party will have to face the leader and its followers
        in a fierce battle, and bring proof of it\u2019s demise back to {1} in order
        to receive their reward.\n[COMBAT with #{0}s, 1 ELITE {0}]\n"

  encounterBlurb: '{1} has called upon a group of adventurers to remove a group of
    {0} that have been terrorizing the nearby countryside.'
  encounterSummary: '{1} explains that the monsters, a -0- of {0}s, have been attacking
    and killing the town''s livestock, causing a shortage of food and putting the
    town in danger of starvation. [1] offers a reward to the adventurers if they
    can successfully remove the {0}s from the area. From information gathered from
    local woodsman, [1] believes that the {0}s can be found near {LOCATION}.'
  encounterApproach: "As you approach the {0}s\u2019 lair, you find yourself in a
    dense forest, with tall trees blocking out much of the sunlight. The ground beneath
    your feet is soft and moist, with fallen leaves and branches scattered about.
    You can hear the distant sound of <0>ing, growing louder as you get closer to
    the lair.\r\nAs you push deeper into the woods, the trees begin to thin out and
    you find yourself at the base of a steep mountain. The mountain is rocky, with
    jagged outcroppings and loose gravel making the climb difficult. You can see
    a faint trail leading up the mountain, and you follow it, carefully making your
    way upward.\r"
