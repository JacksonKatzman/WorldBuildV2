  - actionName: Fist
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature against which
      the revenant has sworn vengeance, the target takes an extra 14 (4d6) bludgeoning
      damage. Instead of dealing damage, the revenant can grapple the target (escape
      DC 14) provided the target is Large or smaller.

'
  - actionName: Vengeful Glare
    actionDescription: 'The revenant targets one creature it can see within 30 feet
      of it and against which it has sworn vengeance. The target must make a DC 15
      Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed until the revenant
      deals damage to it, or until the end of the revenant''s next turn. When the
      paralysis ends, the target is frightened of the revenant for 1 minute. The
      frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
      with disadvantage if it can see the revenant, ending the frightened condition
      on itself on a success.
