  actions:
  - actionName: Thunderous Stomp (Recharge 6)
    actionDescription: 'The storm giant stomps the ground, triggering a thunderclap.
      All other creatures within 15 feet of the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution
      saving throw or take 33 (6d10) thunder damage and be deafened until the start
      of the giant''s next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much
      damage and isn''t deafened. The thunderclap can be heard out to a range of
      1,200 feet.

'
  - actionName: Claw (Fiend Form Only)
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

'
  - actionName: Charm
    actionDescription: 'One humanoid the fiend can see within 30 feet of it must
      succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The
      charmed target obeys the fiend''s verbal or telepathic commands. If the target
      suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw,
      ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the
      effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fiend''s
      Charm for the next 24 hours.

      The fiend can have only one target charmed
      at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.

'
  - actionName: Draining Kiss
    actionDescription: 'The fiend kisses a creature charmed by it or a willing creature.
      The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against this magic,
      taking 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
      on a successful one. The target''s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount
      equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a
      long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to
      0.

'
  - actionName: Etherealness
    actionDescription: 'The fiend magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material
      Plane, or vice versa.
