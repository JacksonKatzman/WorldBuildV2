  - actionName: Luring Song
    actionDescription: "The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant
      within 300 ft. of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11
      Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take
      a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing
      at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.\n     While charmed
      by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies.
      If the charmed target is more than 5 ft. away from the harpy, the must move
      on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity
      attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and
      whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, a target can repeat
      the saving throw. A creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of
      each of its turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends
      on it.\n     A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song
      for the next 24 hours.\n"
