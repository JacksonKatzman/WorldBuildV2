  actions:
  - actionName: Multiattack
    actionDescription: 'The kraken makes three tentacle attacks, each of which it
      can replace with one use of Fling.

'
  - actionName: Bite
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 23 (3d8 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature
      grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While
      swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against
      attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage
      at the start of each of the kraken''s turns. If the kraken takes 50 damage
      or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed
      on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate
      all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the
      kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by
      it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

'
  - actionName: Tentacle
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target.
      Hit: 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC
      18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The kraken has ten
      tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

'
  - actionName: Fling
    actionDescription: 'One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by
      the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone.
      If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning
      damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another
      creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take
      the same damage and be knocked prone.

'
  - actionName: Lightning Storm
    actionDescription: 'The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each
      of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target
      must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage
      on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

'
  legendaryActions:
  - actionName: Tentacle Attack or Fling
    actionDescription: 'The kraken makes one tentacle attack or uses its Fling.

'
  - actionName: Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions)
    actionDescription: 'The kraken uses Lightning Storm.

'
  - actionName: Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions)
    actionDescription: 'While underwater, the kraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot
      radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured
      to creatures other than the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that
      ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking
      16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the
      end of the kraken''s next turn.
