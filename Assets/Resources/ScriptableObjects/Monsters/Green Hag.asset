      Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

'
  - actionName: Illusory Appearance
    actionDescription: 'The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying
      with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general
      size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action
      to end it or if she dies.

      The changes wrought by this effect fail to
      hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth
      skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature
      must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20
      Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

'
  - actionName: Invisible Passage
    actionDescription: 'The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts
      a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
      While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can
      be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with
      her.
