  - actionName: Eye Ray
    actionDescription: 'The zombie uses a random magical eye ray, choosing a target
      that it can see within 60 feet of it.

      1. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted
      creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed
      for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
      its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

      2. Fear Ray. The
      targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened
      for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
      its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

      3. Enervation Ray.
      The targeted creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 36
      (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one.

      4. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
      on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage
      reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray
      dust.

      If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation
      of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target
      is a Huge or larger nonmagical object or creation of magical force, this ray
      disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.
