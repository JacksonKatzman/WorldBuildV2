    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
      Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the stirge attaches to the target. While
      attached, the stirge doesn''t attack. Instead, at the start of each of the
      stirge''s turns, the target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hit points due to blood loss.

      The
      stirge can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after
      it drains 10 hit points of blood from the target or the target dies. A creature,
      including the target, can use its action to detach the stirge.
