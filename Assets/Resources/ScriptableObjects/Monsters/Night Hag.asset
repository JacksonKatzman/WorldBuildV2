  - actionName: Claws (Hag Form Only)
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

'
  - actionName: Change Shape
    actionDescription: 'The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female
      humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form.
      Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn''t transformed. She reverts to
      her true form if she dies.

'
  - actionName: Etherealness
    actionDescription: 'The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material
      Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.

'
  - actionName: Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)
    actionDescription: 'While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a
      sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell
      cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as
      the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last
      for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit
      point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target''s
      hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul
      is trapped in the hag''s soul bag. The reduction to the target''s hit point
      maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.
