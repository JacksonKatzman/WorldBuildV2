  - actionName: Eye Rays
    actionDescription: 'The spectator shoots up to two of the following magical eye
      rays at one or two creatures it can see within 90 ft. of it. It can use each
      ray only once on a turn.

      1. Confusion Ray. The target must succeed on
      a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, or it can''t take reactions until the end of its
      next turn. On its turn, the target can''t move, and it uses its action to make
      a melee or ranged attack against a randomly determined creature within range.
      If the target can''t attack, it does nothing on its turn.

      2. Paralyzing
      Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed
      for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
      its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

      3. Fear Ray. The
      target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
      The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with
      disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the target, ending the effect on
      itself on a success.

      4. Wounding Ray. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution
      saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as
      much damage on a successful one.
