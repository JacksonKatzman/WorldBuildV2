  - actionName: Multiattack
    actionDescription: 'The intellect devourer makes one attack with its claws and
      uses Devour Intellect.

'
  - actionName: Claws
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.

'
  - actionName: Devour Intellect
    actionDescription: 'The intellect devourer targets one creature it can see within
      10 feet of it that has a brain. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence
      saving throw against this magic or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. Also on a
      failure, roll 3d6: If the total equals or exceeds the target''s Intelligence
      score, that score is reduced to 0. The target is stunned until it regains at
      least one point of Intelligence.

'
  - actionName: Body Thief
    actionDescription: 'The intellect devourer initiates an Intelligence contest
      with an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it that isn''t protected by
      protection from evil and good. If it wins the contest, the intellect devourer
      magically consumes the target''s brain, teleports into the target''s skull,
      and takes control of the target''s body. While inside a creature, the intellect
      devourer has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside
      its host. The intellect devourer retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
      scores, as well as its understanding of Deep Speech, its telepathy, and its
      traits. It otherwise adopts the target''s statistics. It knows everything the
      creature knew, including spells and languages.

      If the host body dies,
      the intellect devourer must leave it. A protection from evil and good spell
      cast on the body drives the intellect devourer out. The intellect devourer
      is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a wish.
      By spending 5 feet of its movement, the intellect devourer can voluntarily
      leave the body, teleporting to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of
      it. The body then dies, unless its brain is restored within 1 round.
