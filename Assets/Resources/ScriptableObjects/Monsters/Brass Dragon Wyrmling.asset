      Fire
      Breath. The dragon exhales fire in an 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each
      creature in that line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6)
      fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

      Sleep

      area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious
      for 1 minute. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage
      or someone uses an action to wake it.
