  - actionName: Multiattack
    actionDescription: 'The worm makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with
      its stinger.

'
  - actionName: Bite
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
      Hit: 22 (3d8 + 9) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature,
      it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm.
      A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against
      attacks and other effects outside the worm, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage
      at the start of each of the worm''s turns.

      If the worm takes 30 damage
      or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on
      a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all
      swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the worm.
      If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can
      escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.

'
  - actionName: Tail Stinger
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature.
      Hit: 19 (3d6 + 9) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 19 Constitution
      saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
      damage on a successful one.
