    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
      Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution
      saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
      damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit
      points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining
      hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
