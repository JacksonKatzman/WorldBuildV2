      use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\t\u2022 Magma erupts from a point
      on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high,
      5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15
      Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half
      as much damage on a successful one.\n\t\u2022 A tremor shakes the lair in a
      60-foot-radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the
      ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked
      prone.\n\t\u2022 Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered
      on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around
      corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count
      20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must
      succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of
      its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.\n"
