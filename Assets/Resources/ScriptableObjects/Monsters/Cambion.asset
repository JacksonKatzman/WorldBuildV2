      any harm from the cambion or another creature or receives a suicidal command
      from the cambion, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect
      on itself on a success. If a target''s saving throw is successful, or if the
      effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the cambion''s Fiendish Charm
      for the next 24 hours.
