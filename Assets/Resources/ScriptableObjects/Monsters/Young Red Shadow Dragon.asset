    actionDescription: 'The dragon exhales shadowy fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature
      in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) necrotic
      damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A humanoid
      reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies, and an undead shadow rises from
      its corpse and acts immediately after the dragon in the initiative count. The
      shadow is under the dragon''s control.
