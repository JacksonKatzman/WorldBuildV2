  - actionName: Bite
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
      Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution
      saving throw or be poisoned for 24 hours. Until this poison ends, the target
      is unconscious. Another creature can use an action to shake the target awake.

'
  - actionName: Constrict
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one Medium
      or smaller creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is
      grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained,
      and the couatl can''t constrict another target.

'
  - actionName: Change Shape
    actionDescription: 'The couatl magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast
      that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its
      true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing
      or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the couatl''s choice).

      In
      a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but
      its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced
      by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except
      class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has
      but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its
      bite in that form.
