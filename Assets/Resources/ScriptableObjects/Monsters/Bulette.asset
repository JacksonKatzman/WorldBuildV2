  - actionName: Deadly Leap
    actionDescription: 'If the bulette jumps at least 15 ft. as part of its movement,
      it can then use this action to land on its ft. in a space that contains one
      or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength
      or Dexterity saving throw (target''s choice) or be knocked prone and take 14
      (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. On a successful
      save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn''t knocked prone, and is
      pushed 5 ft. out of the bulette''s space into an unoccupied space of the creature''s
      choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls
      prone in the bulette''s space.
