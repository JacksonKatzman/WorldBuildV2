    actionDescription: 'The devil makes two attacks: one with its beard and one with
      its glaive.

'
  - actionName: Beard
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
      Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution
      saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target
      can''t regain hit points. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end
      of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

'
  - actionName: Glaive
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
      Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an
      undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw
      or lose 5 (1d10) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal
      wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage
      dealt by the wound increases by 5 (1d10). Any creature can take an action to
      stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound
      also closes if the target receives magical healing.
