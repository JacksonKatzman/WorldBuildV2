  - actionName: Summon Air Elemental
    actionDescription: 'Five aarakocra within 30 feet of each other can magically
      summon an air elemental. Each of the five must use its action and movement
      on three consecutive turns to perform an aerial dance and must maintain concentration
      while doing so (as if concentrating on a spell). When all five have finished
      their third turn of the dance, the elemental appears in an unoccupied space
      within 60 feet of them. It is friendly toward them and obeys their spoken commands.
      It remains for 1 hour, until it or all its summoners die, or until any of its
      summoners dismisses it as a bonus action. A summoner can''t perform the dance
      again until it finishes a short rest. When the elemental returns to the Elemental
      Plane of Air, any aarakocra within 5 feet of it can return with it.
