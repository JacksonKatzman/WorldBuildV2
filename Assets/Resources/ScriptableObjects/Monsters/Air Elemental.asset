'
  - actionName: Whirlwind (Recharge 4-6)
    actionDescription: 'Each creature in the elemental''s space must make a DC 13
      Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning
      damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the elemental in a random direction
      and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or
      floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was
      thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed
      on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

      If
      the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage
      and isn''t flung away or knocked prone.
