    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit (+6 to hit with shillelagh),

  - actionName: Fey Charm
    actionDescription: 'The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see
      within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on
      a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards
      the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target
      isn''t under the dryad''s control, it takes the dryad''s requests or actions
      in the most favorable way it can.

      Each time the dryad or its allies
      do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the
      effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until
      the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends
      the effect as a bonus action. If a target''s saving throw is successful, the
      target is immune to the dryad''s Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.

      The
      dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at
      a time.
