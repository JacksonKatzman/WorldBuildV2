  actions:
  - actionName: Withering Touch
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage.

'
  - actionName: Etherealness
    actionDescription: 'The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane,
      or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border
      Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can''t affect or be affected by anything on
      the other plane.

'
  - actionName: Horrifying Visage
    actionDescription: 'Each non-undead creature within 60 ft. of the ghost that
      can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for
      1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 _ 10 years.
      A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
      ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target''s saving
      throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this
      ghost''s Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed
      with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.

'
  - actionName: Possession (Recharge 6)
    actionDescription: "One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 ft. of it must
      succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the
      ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of
      its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of
      awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect,
      except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom,
      Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the
      possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge,
      class features, or proficiencies.\n     The possession lasts until the body
      drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is
      turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When
      the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft.
      of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after
      succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.\n"
