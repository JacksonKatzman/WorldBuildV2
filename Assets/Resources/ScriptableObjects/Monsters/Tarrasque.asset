  actions:
  - actionName: Multiattack
    actionDescription: 'The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes
      five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and
      one with its tai l. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.

'
  - actionName: Bite
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
      Hit: 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled
      (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the
      tarrasque can''t bite another target.

'
  - actionName: Claw
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
      Hit: 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage.

'
  - actionName: Horns
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
      Hit: 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage.

'
  - actionName: Tail
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.
      Hit: 24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must
      succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

'
  - actionName: Frightful Presence
    actionDescription: 'Each creature of the tarrasque''s choice within 120 feet
      of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become
      frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end
      of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of
      sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature''s saving throw
      is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque''s
      Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

'
  - actionName: Swallow
    actionDescription: 'The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller
      creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite''s
      damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the
      creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and
      other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at
      the start of each of the tarrasque''s turns.

      If the tarrasque takes
      60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque
      must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or
      regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10
      feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer
      restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement,
      exiting prone.
