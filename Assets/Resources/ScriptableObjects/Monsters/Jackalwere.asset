      feet of it. The target must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
      the target succumbs to a magical slumber, falling unconscious for 10 minutes
      or until someone uses an action to shake the target awake. A creature that
      successfully saves against the effect is immune to this jackalwere''s gaze
      for the next 24 hours. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren''t
      affected by it.
