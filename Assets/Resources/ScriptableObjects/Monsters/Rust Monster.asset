  - actionName: Antennae
    actionDescription: 'The rust monster corrodes a nonmagical ferrous metal object
      it can see within 5 feet of it. If the object isn''t being worn or carried,
      the touch destroys a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried
      by a creature, the creature can make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid
      the rust monster''s touch.

      If the object touched is either metal armor
      or a metal shield being worn or carried, its takes a permanent and cumulative
      -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that
      drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If the object touched is a held metal weapon,
      it rusts as described in the Rust Metal trait.
