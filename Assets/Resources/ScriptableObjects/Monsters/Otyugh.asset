  - actionName: Multiattack
    actionDescription: 'The otyugh makes three attacks: one with its bite and two
      with its tentacles.

'
  - actionName: Bite
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
      on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until
      the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the
      saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The
      disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit
      point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target''s hit point maximum lasts
      until the disease is cured.

'
  - actionName: Tentacle
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
      Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) piercing damage. If the target
      is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13) and restrained until the
      grapple ends. The otyugh has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

'
  - actionName: Tentacle Slam
    actionDescription: 'The otyugh slams creatures grappled by it into each other
      or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving
      throw or take 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and be stunned until the end
      of the otyugh''s next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the
      bludgeoning damage and isn''t stunned.
