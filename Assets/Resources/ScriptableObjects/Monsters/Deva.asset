  - actionName: Mace
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) radiant damage.

'
  - actionName: Healing Touch (3/Day)
    actionDescription: 'The deva touches another creature. The target magically regains
      20 (4d8 + 2) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness,
      or deafness.

'
  - actionName: Change Shape
    actionDescription: 'The deva magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that
      has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true
      form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or
      carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the deva''s choice).

      In
      a new form, the deva retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but
      its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced
      by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except
      class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has
      but that it lacks.
