    actionDescription: 'The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.

'
  - actionName: Scimitar
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage
      (djinni''s choice).

'
  - actionName: Create Whirlwind
    actionDescription: 'A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically
      forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts
      as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell).
      Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC
      18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind
      up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move
      with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

      A creature
      can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including
      itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the
      creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the
      whirlwind.
