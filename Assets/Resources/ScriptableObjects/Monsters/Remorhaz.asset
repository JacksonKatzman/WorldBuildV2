  - actionName: Bite
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
      Hit: 40 (6d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage. If the target
      is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the
      target is restrained, and the remorhaz can''t bite another target.

'
  - actionName: Swallow
    actionDescription: 'The remorhaz makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller
      creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite''s
      damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature
      is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects
      outside the remorhaz, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each
      of the remorhaz''s turns.

      If the remorhaz takes 30 damage or more on
      a single turn from a creature inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a DC
      15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed
      creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet oft he remorhaz. If the
      remorhaz dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape
      from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.
