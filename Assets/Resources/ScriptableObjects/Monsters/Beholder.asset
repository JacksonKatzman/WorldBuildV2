  - actionName: Eye Rays
    actionDescription: 'The beholder shoots three of the following magical eye rays
      at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within
      120 ft. of it:

      1. Charm Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a
      DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until
      the beholder harms the creature.

      2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature
      must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute.
      The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
      the effect on itself on a success.

      3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature
      must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
      The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
      the effect on itself on a success.

      4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature
      must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target''s
      speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can''t take reactions,
      and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The
      creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
      the effect on itself on a success.

      5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature
      must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage
      on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

      6. Telekinetic
      Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving
      throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 ft. in any direction. It is restrained
      by the ray''s telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder''s next turn
      or until the beholder is incapacitated.

      If the target is an object weighing
      300 pounds or less that isn''t being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30
      ft. in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with
      this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.

      7.
      Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw
      or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it
      takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no
      effect on constructs and undead.

      8. Petrification Ray. The targeted
      creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
      begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw
      at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the
      creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other
      magic.

      9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
      on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage
      reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray
      dust.

      If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation
      of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target
      is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates
      a 10-foot cube of it.

      10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed
      on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target
      dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.
