    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
      on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until
      the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the creature must repeat
      the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure.
      This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease
      reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
