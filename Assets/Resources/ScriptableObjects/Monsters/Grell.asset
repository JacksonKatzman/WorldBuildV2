      Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution
      saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target is paralyzed,
      and it can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
      the effect on a success.

      The target is also grappled (escape DC 15).

      ends. While grappling the target, the grell has advantage on attack rolls against
      it and can ''t use this attack against other targets. When the grell moves,
      any Medium or smaller target it is grappling moves with it.
