  actions:
  - actionName: Multiattack
    actionDescription: 'The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one
      with its tail.

'
  - actionName: Bite
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
      Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the
      cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the
      cloaker attaches to the target''s head, and the target is blinded and unable
      to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make
      this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The
      cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including
      the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC
      16 Strength check.

'
  - actionName: Tail
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature.
      Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

'
  - actionName: Moan
    actionDescription: 'Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear
      its moan and that isn''t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving
      throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker''s next turn. If a
      creature''s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker''s
      moan for the next 24 hours.

'
  - actionName: Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)
    actionDescription: 'The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of
      itself if it isn''t in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic
      its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker
      is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates
      disappear.

      Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack
      or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly
      to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature
      is unaffected by this magical effect if it can''t see or if it relies on senses
      other than sight.

      A duplicate has the cloaker''s AC and uses its saving
      throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw
      against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.
