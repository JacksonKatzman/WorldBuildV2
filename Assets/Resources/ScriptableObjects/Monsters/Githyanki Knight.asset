  - actionName: Silver Greatsword
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) psychic damage. This is a magic
      weapon attack. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with
      the astral projection spell), the githyanki can cut the silvery cord that tethers
      the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
