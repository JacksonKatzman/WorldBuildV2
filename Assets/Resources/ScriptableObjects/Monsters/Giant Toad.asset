      Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) poison damage, and the target
      is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained,

'
  - actionName: Swallow
    actionDescription: 'The toad makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller
      target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the
      grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total
      cover against attacks and other effects outside the toad, and it takes 10 (3d6)
      acid damage at the start of each of the toad''s turns. The toad can have only
      one target swallowed at a time.

      If the toad dies, a swallowed creature
      is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of
      movement, exiting prone.
