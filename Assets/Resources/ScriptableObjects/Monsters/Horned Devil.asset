      Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage.

'
  - actionName: Tail
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
      Hit: 10 (1d8 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than an
      undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw
      or lose 10 (3d6) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal
      wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage
      dealt by the wound increases by 10 (3d6). Any creature can take an action to
      stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound
      also closes if the target receives magical healing.

'
