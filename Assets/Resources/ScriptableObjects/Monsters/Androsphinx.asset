      must make a saving throw.


      First Roar. Each creature that fails a DC
      18 Wisdom saving throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can
      repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
      on itself on a success.


      Second Roar. Each creature that fails a DC
      18 Wisdom saving throw is deafened and frightened for 1 minute. A frightened
      creature is paralyzed and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
      its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


      Third Roar. Each
      creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
      takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save,
      the creature takes half as much damage and isn''t knocked prone.
