  actions:
  - actionName: Multiattack
    actionDescription: 'The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to
      constrict.

'
  - actionName: Bite
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
      Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage.

'
  - actionName: Constrict
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or
      smaller creature. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10 + 6)
      slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the behir isn''t
      already constricting a creature, and the target is restrained until this grapple
      ends.

'
  - actionName: Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)
    actionDescription: 'The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 ft. long
      and 5 ft. wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving
      throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much
      damage on a successful one.

'
  - actionName: Swallow
    actionDescription: 'The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller
      target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and
      the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it
      has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it
      takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir''s turns. A behir
      can have only one creature swallowed at a time.

      If the behir takes 30
      damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must
      succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate
      the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 ft. of the behir. If the
      behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape
      from the corpse by using 15 ft. of movement, exiting prone.
