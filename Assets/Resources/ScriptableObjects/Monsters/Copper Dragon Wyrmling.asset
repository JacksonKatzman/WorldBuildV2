    actionDescription: 'The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

      Acid
      Breath. The dragon exhales acid in an 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each
      creature in that line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8)
      acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

      Slowing
      Breath. The dragon exhales gas in a 1 5-foot cone. Each creature in that area
      must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
      can''t use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can''t make more than one
      attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a
      bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The
      creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
      the effect on itself with a successful save.
