  - actionName: Multiattack
    actionDescription: 'The devil makes two attacks with its chains.

'
  - actionName: Chain
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
      Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if
      the devil isn''t already grappling a creature. Until this grapple ends, the
      target is restrained and takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at the start of each
      of its turns.

'
  - actionName: Animate Chains (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)
    actionDescription: 'Up to four chains the devil can see within 60 feet of it
      magically sprout razor-edged barbs and animate under the devil''s control,
      provided that the chains aren''t being worn or carried.

      Each animated
      chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance to piercing damage,
      and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When the devil uses Multiattack
      on its turn, it can use each animated chain to make one additional chain attack.
      An animated chain can grapple one creature of its own but can''t make attacks
      while grappling. An animated chain reverts to its inanimate state if reduced
      to 0 hit points or if the devil is incapacitated or dies.
