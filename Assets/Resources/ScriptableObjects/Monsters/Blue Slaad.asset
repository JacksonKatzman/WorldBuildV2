    actionDescription: 'The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two
      with its claws.

'
  - actionName: Bite
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.

'
  - actionName: Claw
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed
      on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease called chaos
      phage. While infected, the target can''t regain hit points, and its hit point
      maximum is reduced by 10 (3d6) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces the target''s
      hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a red slaad or,
      if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green slaad.
      Only a wish spell can reverse the transformation.
