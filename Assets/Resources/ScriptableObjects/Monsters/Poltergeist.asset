  - actionName: Telekinetic Thrust
    actionDescription: 'The poltergeist targets a creature or unattended object within
      30 feet of it. A creature must be Medium or smaller to be affected by this
      magic, and an object can weigh up to 150 pounds.

      If the target is a
      creature, the poltergeist makes a Charisma check contested by the target''s
      Strength check. If the poltergeist wins the contest, the poltergeist hurls
      the target up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward. If the target
      then comes into contact with a hard surface or heavy object, the target takes
      1d6 damage per 10 feet moved.

      If the target is an object that isn''t
      being worn or carried, the poltergeist hurls it up to 30 feet in any direction.
      The poltergeist can use the object as a ranged weapon, attacking one creature
      along the object''s path (+4 to hit) and dealing 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage
      on a hit.
