  - actionName: Whelm (Recharge 4-6)
    actionDescription: 'Each creature in the elemental''s space must make a DC 15
      Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning
      damage. If it is Large or smaller, it is also grappled (escape DC 14). Until
      this grapple ends, the target is restrained and unable to breathe unless it
      can breathe water. If the saving throw is successful, the target is pushed
      out of the elemental''s space.

      The elemental can grapple one Large creature
      or up to two Medium or smaller creatures at one time. At the start of each
      of the elemental''s turns, each target grappled by it takes 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning
      damage. A creature within 5 feet of the elemental can pull a creature or object
      out of it by taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength and succeeding.
