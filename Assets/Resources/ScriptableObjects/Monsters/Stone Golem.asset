    actionDescription: 'The golem targets one or more creatures it can see within
      10 ft. of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this
      magic. On a failed save, a target can''t use reactions, its speed is halved,
      and it can''t make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target
      can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects
      last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
      of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
