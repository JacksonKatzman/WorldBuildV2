  - actionName: Read Thoughts
    actionDescription: 'The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of
      one creature within 60 ft. of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3
      ft. of wood or dirt, 2 ft. of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of
      lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue
      reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger''s concentration isn''t broken
      (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target''s mind, the doppelganger
      has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and
      Persuasion) checks against the target.
