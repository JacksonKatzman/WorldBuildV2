      creature in that line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6)
      fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

      Sleep

      area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious
      for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage
      or someone uses an action to wake it.

'
  - actionName: Change Shape
    actionDescription: 'The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast
      that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form.
      It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying
      is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon''s choice).

      In a new
      form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak,
      proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom,
      and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities
      are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features
      or legendary actions of that form.
