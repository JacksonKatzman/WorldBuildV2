    actionDescription: 'The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a
      bite attack.

'
  - actionName: Bite
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing
      creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or
      restrained. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
      The target''s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic
      damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The
      reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this
      effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

'
  - actionName: Claws
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
      Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can
      grapple the target (escape DC 13).
