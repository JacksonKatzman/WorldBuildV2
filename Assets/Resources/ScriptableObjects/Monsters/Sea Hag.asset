    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

'
  - actionName: Death Glare
    actionDescription: 'The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within
      30 ft. of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom
      saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.

'
  - actionName: Illusory Appearance
    actionDescription: 'The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying
      with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general
      size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to
      end it or if she dies.

      The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold
      up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws,
      but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must
      take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence
      (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.
