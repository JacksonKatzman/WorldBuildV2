  - actionName: Multiattack
    actionDescription: 'The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one attack
      with its rotting fist.

'
  - actionName: Rotting Fist
    actionDescription: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the
      target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw
      or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can''t regain hit points, and
      its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse.
      If the curse reduces the target''s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies,
      and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse
      spell or other magic.

'
  - actionName: Dreadful Glare
    actionDescription: 'The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 ft. of
      it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving
      throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy''s
      next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed
      for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune
      to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24
      hours.
