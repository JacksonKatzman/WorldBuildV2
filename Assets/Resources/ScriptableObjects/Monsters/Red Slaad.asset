  - actionName: Claw
    actionDescription: "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed
      on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease \u2014 a
      minuscule slaad egg.\nA humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term
      at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates,
      and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host
      starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack
      rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way
      through vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host
      in the process.\nIf the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the
      unborn slaad is disintegrated.\n"
