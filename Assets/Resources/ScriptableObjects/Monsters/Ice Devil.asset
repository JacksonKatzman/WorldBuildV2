  - actionName: Wall of Ice
    actionDescription: 'The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid
      surface it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to
      30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it''s a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet
      in diameter.

      When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed
      out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall
      to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes
      a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save,
      or half as much damage on a successful one.

      The wall lasts for 1 minute
      or until the devil is incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached;
      each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage,
      and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section
      is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall
      occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn,
      willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving
      throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
      on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.
