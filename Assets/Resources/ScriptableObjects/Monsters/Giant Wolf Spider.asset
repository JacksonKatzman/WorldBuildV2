    actionDescription: 'Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit:
      4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution
      saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
      damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit
      points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining
      hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
