    actionDescription: 'A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from
      the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured.
      It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that
      starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw
      or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way,
      the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both,
      and can''t take reactions.
