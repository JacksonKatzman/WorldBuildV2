  - actionName: Eye Rays
    actionDescription: 'The death tyrant shoots three of the following magical eye
      rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see
      within 120 ft. of it:

      1. Charm Ray. The targeted creature must succeed
      on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the death tyrant for 1 hour,
      or until the death tyrant harms the creature.

      2. Paralyzing Ray. The
      targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed
      for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
      its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

      3. Fear Ray. The
      targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened
      for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
      its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

      4. Slowing Ray.
      The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a
      failed save, the target''s speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature
      can''t take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on
      its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
      each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

      5. Enervation
      Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking
      36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one.

      6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
      on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or the death tyrant moves it up to 30 ft.
      in any direction. It is restrained by the ray''s telekinetic grip until the
      start of the death tyrant''s next turn or until the death tyrant is incapacitated.

      If
      the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn''t being worn
      or carried, it is moved up to 30 ft. in any direction. The death tyrant can
      also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple
      tool or opening a door or a container.

      7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature
      must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious
      for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes
      an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.

      8.
      Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving
      throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained.
      It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success,
      the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the
      greater restoration spell or other magic.

      9. Disintegration Ray. If
      the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw
      or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit
      points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.

      If the target is
      a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated
      without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation
      of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.

      10. Death
      Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or
      take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0
      hit points.
